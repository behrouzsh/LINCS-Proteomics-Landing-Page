        <p class="lead">SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra) is a new strategy for high throughput, label-free protein quantification. It generates global, quantitative protein maps using data-independent acquisition of collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra of all precursor ions. As a data-independent acquisition (also referred to as MS/MSall) SWATH-MS has a greater coverage of peptide identification compared to classical discovery approaches. Using known fingerprints of target peptides comprising precursor mass, chromatographic retention time and MRM transitions SWATH protein maps can be interrogated for targeted quantification of proteins of interest based on high resolution MRM-like signatures. SWATH acquires all MRM transitions of all precursors and thus does not require tedious assay development and allows for a more dynamic data interpretation compared to classical MRM experiments. New proteins can be added to the list of targets during the process of data interpretation without the requirement of additional data acquisition.  </p>

        <p class="lead"> Mass spectrometry is a sensitive technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions to identify and quantify molecules in simple and complex mixtures. Samples are loaded into the mass spectrometer in liquid, gas or dried form and then vaporized and ionized by the ion source. The charge that these molecules receive allows the mass spectrometer to accelerate the ions throughout the remainder of the system. The ions encounter electric and/or magnetic fields from mass analyzers, which deflect the paths of individual ions based on their mass and charge (m/z). Ions that have successfully been deflected by the mass analyzers then hit the ion detector that registers the number of ions at each m/z value.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) is a high-throughput technology that performs protein assays on thousands of samples simultaneously, including tissue and cell lysates, serum, plasma or other body fluids that measure the levels of protein expression, as well as protein modifications such as phosphorylation. Protein lysates are arrayed as microspots on nitrocellulized coated glass slides and probed with highly specific antibodies that have been validated for RPPA. When specific antibodies are used, RPPA can generate 1,000 times more data points using 10,000 times less sample volume than an ordinary western blot, enabling researchers to monitor quantitative proteomic responses for various time-scale and input-dose gradients simultaneously.</p>

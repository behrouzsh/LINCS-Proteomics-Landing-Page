    <h2>LINCS Proteomics Landing Page</h2>
    <p >

        The LINCS-Proteomics portal is designed to provide a guide and a starting point for exploration of LINCS proteomic data and related resources.

<h2>PiLINCS</h2>
<p >
    <a href="http://eh3.uc.edu/pilincs/#/" target="_blank">
        <span style="color:blue">&#10004;</span> piLINCS</a> has been developed as part of the BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center
    to provide interactive and API access to proteomics data generated by the Library of Integrated
    Network-based Signatures (LINCS) program. At present, piLINCS enables access to the reduced
    representation phosphoproteomic ("P100") and global chromatin ("GCP") profiles generated by using
    mass spectrometry techniques to characterize proteome level molecular signatures of (responses to)
    small molecule and genetic perturbations in a number of different cell lines
    (for details see LINCS/Broad). These different profiles (obtained by merging QC+NORM level
    processed GCT files from Panorama repository) can be browsed interactively, filtered based on user
    defined selection of cell - perturbation - dose tuples, merged across different profiles (for the
    same tuples), analyzed in iLINCS (more tools to come), and exported in several different formats.

<h2>PiNet</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://eh3.uc.edu/pinet/" target="_blank">
        <span style="color:blue">&#10004;</span> piNet</a> can be used to annotate, map and analyze a set of peptide moieties
    (including post-translationally modified peptides) identified by either
    targeted (SRM type) or SWATH (discovery) proteomic assays, or another
    related mass spectrometry based protein moieties identification and
    quantification technique. Starting from a set of peptides, and optional
    modifications within those peptides, piNET provides mapping into
    canonical UniProt protein entries, standardized annotation of
    modifications using PsiMOD ontology, and mapping of the sites of PTMs in
    the full UniProt entries. piNET further generates Protein Line Notation
    tokens to represent each peptide moiety with modifications for automated
    annotation exchange systems. The set of proteins and PTM sites can be
    further projected onto biological pathways using enrichment analysis and
    a comprehensive library of biological gene/protein sets through Enrichr.
    For phosphorylation, PhosphoSitePlus known kinase - target peptides (and
    extrapolations form known examples to sufficiently similar putative
    target peptides) are used to provide a site specific network and
    pathways views. Work is in progress to extend the capabilities to
    include other PTMs in network projections, and to enable annotation of
    mouse and rat proteomics data.
